## What and why

Imaging some genie gives you a magical device that shows your health as a number from 0 to 100. It shows 100 in your 25 when you are healthy and mature. When it drops down to 0, game over and you are dead. How could you use such a device?

First, it can make your clinical trials quicker and cheaper. If you conduct a clinical trial to find an anti-age drug, then the primary outcome of the trial is the participants' lifespan. Since people live 72 years on average, there are chances that you die before the trial's end. It is costly also. For example, TAME clinical trial {cite}`barzilai2016metformin` is underway. TAME -- Targeting Aging with Metformin -- has collected 11 million dollars out of the needed 40 for the last seven years, and the trial will last for 6 years once launched.
