	abstract = {Age-related changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) form the basis for the development of most robust predictors of age, epigenetic clocks, but a clear mechanistic basis for what exactly they quantify is lacking. Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we analyzed the aging dynamics of bulk-tissue and single-cell DNAm, together with single-cell DNAm changes during early development. We show that aging DNAm changes are widespread, but are relatively slow and small in amplitude, with DNAm levels trending towards intermediate values and showing increased heterogeneity with age. By considering dominant types of DNAm changes, we find that aging manifests in the exponential decay-like loss or gain of methylation with a universal rate, independent of the initial level of DNAm. We further show that aging is dominated by the stochastic component, yet co-regulated changes are also present during both development and adulthood. We support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated CpG clusters that may provide new opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While autophagy is intimately linked to health, the intricate relationship among autophagy, aging and disease remains unclear. This Review examines several emerging features of autophagy and postulates how they may be linked to aging as well as to the development and progression of disease. In addition, we discuss current preclinical evidence arguing for the use of autophagy modulators as suppressors of age-related pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we highlight key questions and propose novel research avenues that will likely reveal new links between autophagy and the hallmarks of aging. Understanding the precise interplay between autophagy and the risk of age-related pathologies across organisms will eventually facilitate the development of clinical applications that promote long-term health.},

Age-related changes occur at most levels of organization of a living organism (molecular, organellar, cellular, tissue and organ). However, protein synthesis is a major biological process, and thus understanding how it changes with age is of paramount importance. Here, we discuss the relationships between lifespan, aging, protein synthesis and translational control, and expand this analysis to the various aspects of proteome behavior in organisms with age. Characterizing the consequences of changes in protein synthesis and translation fidelity, and determining whether altered translation is pathological or adaptive is necessary for understanding the aging process, as well as for developing approaches to target dysfunction in translation as a strategy for extending lifespan.},

  abstract = {Autophagy is a major protein turnover pathway by which cellular components are delivered into the lysosomes for degradation and recycling. This intracellular process is able to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions, and its dysregulation could lead to the development of physiological alterations. The autophagic activity has been found to decrease with age, likely contributing to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules and organelles during aging. Interestingly, failure of the autophagic process has been reported to worsen aging-associated diseases, such as neurodegeneration or cancer, among others. Likewise, it has been proposed in different organisms that maintenance of a proper autophagic activity contributes to extending longevity. In this review, we discuss recent papers showing the impact of autophagy on cell activity and age-associated diseases, highlighting the relevance of this process to the hallmarks of aging. Thus, understanding how autophagy plays an important role in aging opens new avenues for the discovery of biochemical and pharmacological targets and the development of novel anti-aging therapeutic approaches.},

We compared them to examine whether they demonstrated common characteristics of frailty scales, and to examine their association with adverse health measures including disability, self-reported health, and healthcare utilization. The study examined adults aged 50+ (n=4096) from a sequential, cross-sectional sample (2003\textendash 2004; 2005\textendash 2006), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The frailty phenotype was modified from a previously adapted version and a 46-item frailty index was created following a standard protocol. Both measures demonstrated a right-skewed distribution, higher levels of frailty in women, exponential increase with age and associations with high healthcare utilization and poor self-reported health. More people classified as frail by the modified phenotype had ADL disability (97.8\%) compared with the frailty index (56.6\%) and similarly for IADL disability (95\% vs. 85.6\%). The prevalence of frailty was 3.6\% using the modified frailty phenotype and 34\% using the frailty index. Frailty index scores in those who were classified as robust by the modified phenotype were still significantly associated with poor self-reported health and high healthcare utilization. The frailty index and the modified frailty phenotype each confirmed previously established characteristics of frailty scales. The agreement between frailty and disability was high with each measure, suggesting that frailty is not simply a pre-disability stage. Overall, the frailty index classified more people as frail, and suggested that it may have the ability to discriminate better at the lower to middle end of the frailty continuum.},

Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species, and on long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans8, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Notably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied showing a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species we examined\textemdash including variation of around 30-fold in lifespan and around 40,000-fold in body mass\textemdash the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of around 3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals, and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing.},

To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation and found strong, non-random associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms in humans, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway were associated with multiple aging mechanisms and diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging hence contribute both together and individually to age-related disease co-occurrence in humans and could potentially be targeted accordingly to prevent multimorbidity.},

  abstract = {Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylase and deacylase enzymes that control important cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, cellular metabolism, mitochondrial function and inflammation. Consequently, mammalian sirtuins are regarded as crucial regulators of cellular function and organism healthspan. Sirtuin activity and NAD+ levels decrease with age in many tissues, and reduced sirtuin expression is associated with several cardiovascular diseases. By contrast, increased sirtuin expression and activity slows disease progression and improves cardiovascular function in preclinical models and delays various features of cellular ageing. The potential cardiometabolic benefits of sirtuins have resulted in clinical trials with sirtuin-modulating agents; although expectations are high, these drugs have not yet been proven to improve healthspan. In this Review, we examine the role of sirtuins in atherosclerosis, summarize advances in the development of compounds that activate or inhibit sirtuin activity and critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of these agents.},

Here we combined nascent RNA sequencing and RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in wild-type aged mice. We found that in 2-year-old liver, 40\% of elongating RNA polymerases are stalled, lowering productive transcription and skewing transcriptional output in a gene-length-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that this transcriptional stress is caused by endogenous DNA damage and explains the majority of gene expression changes in aging in most mainly postmitotic organs, specifically affecting aging hallmark pathways such as nutrient sensing, autophagy, proteostasis, energy metabolism, immune function and cellular stress resilience. Age-related transcriptional stress is evolutionary conserved from nematodes to humans. Thus, accumulation of stochastic endogenous DNA damage during aging deteriorates basal transcription, which establishes the age-related transcriptome and causes dysfunction of key aging hallmark pathways, disclosing how DNA damage functionally underlies major aspects of normal aging.},

Utilizing a temperature-sensitive sterile strain with a normal life span, a method is described for the isolation of mutant strains with significantly increased life spans. Eight mutant strains were isolated each having increased life spans. Two mutant strains were spontaneous dauer formers, accounting for their increased longevity. Another was chemotaxis-defective, causing reduced food intake which could account for its increased life span. Five mutants suffered from varying degrees of paralysis affecting their rate of pharyngeal pumping and food ingestion. The high correlation of the decreased rate of food ingestion of these mutants with their increased longevity is interpreted as indicating that the increased longevity is most likely due to reduced caloric intake. These results appear to indicate that specific life span genes are extremely rare or, alternatively, life span is controlled in a polygenic fashion.},

  abstract = {The nuclear envelope (NE) is the central organizing unit of the eukaryotic cell serving as a genome protective barrier and mechanotransduction interface between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The NE is mainly composed of a nuclear lamina and a double membrane connected at specific points where the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form. Physiological aging might be generically defined as a functional decline across lifespan observed from the cellular to organismal level. Therefore, during aging and premature aging, several cellular alterations occur, including nuclear-specific changes, particularly, altered nuclear transport, increased genomic instability induced by DNA damage, and telomere attrition. Here, we highlight and discuss proteins associated with nuclear transport dysfunction induced by aging, particularly nucleoporins, nuclear transport factors, and lamins. Moreover, changes in the structure of chromatin and consequent heterochromatin rearrangement upon aging are discussed. These alterations correlate with NE dysfunction, particularly lamins' alterations. Finally, telomere attrition is addressed and correlated with altered levels of nuclear lamins and nuclear lamina-associated proteins. Overall, the identification of molecular mechanisms underlying NE dysfunction, including upstream and downstream events, which have yet to be unraveled, will be determinant not only to our understanding of several pathologies, but as here discussed, in the aging process.},

We found that transient reprogramming restored youthful gene expression in adipogenic cells and mesenchymal stem cells but also temporarily suppressed somatic cell identity programs. We further screened Yamanaka Factor subsets and found that many combinations had an impact on aging gene expression and suppressed somatic identity, but that these effects were not tightly entangled. We also found that a transient reprogramming approach inspired by amphibian regeneration restored youthful gene expression in aged myogenic cells. Our results suggest that transient pluripotent reprogramming poses a neoplastic risk, but that restoration of youthful gene expression can be achieved with alternative strategies.},

Here we present cell state transition assessment and regulation (cSTAR), an approach for mapping cell states, modelling transitions between them and predicting targeted interventions to convert cell fate decisions. cSTAR uses omics data as input, classifies cell states, and develops a workflow that transforms the input data into mechanistic models that identify a core signalling network, which controls cell fate transitions by influencing whole-cell networks. By integrating signalling and phenotypic data, cSTAR models how cells manoeuvre in Waddington's landscape1 and make decisions about which cell fate to adopt. Notably, cSTAR devises interventions to control the movement of cells in Waddington's landscape. Testing cSTAR in a cellular model of differentiation and proliferation shows a high correlation between quantitative predictions and experimental data. Applying cSTAR to different types of perturbation and omics datasets, including single-cell data, demonstrates its flexibility and scalability and provides new biological insights. The ability of cSTAR to identify targeted perturbations that interconvert cell fates will enable designer approaches for manipulating cellular development pathways and mechanistically underpinned therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Telomere dysfunction activates p53-mediated cellular growth arrest, senescence and apoptosis to drive progressive atrophy and functional decline in high-turnover tissues. The broader adverse impact of telomere dysfunction across many tissues including more quiescent systems prompted transcriptomic network analyses to identify common mechanisms operative in haematopoietic stem cells, heart and liver. These unbiased studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha and beta (PGC-1{$\alpha$} and PGC-1{$\beta$}, also known as Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively) and the downstream network in mice null for either telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) or telomerase RNA component (Terc) genes. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction is associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function, decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or PGC-1{$\alpha$} expression or germline deletion of p53 (also known as Trp53) substantially restores PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function and gluconeogenesis. We demonstrate that telomere dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC-1{$\alpha$} and PGC-1{$\beta$} promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere and mitochondrial biology. We propose that this telomere\textendash p53\textendash PGC axis contributes to organ and metabolic failure and to diminishing organismal fitness in the setting of telomere dysfunction.},

It is currently well established that DNA methylation biomarkers can determine biological age of any tissue across the entire human lifespan, even during development. There is growing evidence suggesting epigenetic age acceleration to be strongly linked to common diseases or occurring in response to various environmental factors. DNA methylation based clocks are proposed as biomarkers of early disease risk as well as predictors of life expectancy and mortality. In this review, we will summarize key advances in epigenetic clocks and their potential application in precision health. We will also provide an overview of progresses in epigenetic biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, we will highlight the importance of prospective study designs to identify and confirm epigenetic biomarkers of disease.},

  abstract = {Telomere erosion and mitochondrial dysfunction are prominent features of aging cells with progressive declines of cellular functions. Whether telomere injury induces mitochondrial dysfunction in human T lymphocytes, the major component of adaptive host immunity against infection and malignancy, remains unclear. We have recently shown that disruption of telomere integrity by KML001, a telomere-targeting drug, induces T cell senescence and apoptosis via the telomeric DNA damage response (DDR). In this study, we used KML001 to further investigate the role and mechanism of telomere injury in mitochondrial dysregulation in aging T cells. We demonstrate that targeting telomeres by KML001 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial swelling and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption, glycolysis, and ATP energy production. Mechanistically, we found that the KML001-induced telomeric DDR activated p53 signaling, which in turn repressed the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1{$\alpha$}) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), leading to T cell mitochondrial dysfunction. These results, forging a direct link between telomeric and mitochondrial biology, shed new light on the human T cell aging network, and demonstrate that the p53-PGC-1{$\alpha$}-NRF-1 axis contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in the setting of telomeric DDR. This study suggests that targeting this axis may offer an alternative, novel approach to prevent telomere damage-mediated mitochondrial and T cell dysfunctions to combat a wide range of immune aging-associated human diseases.}

However, whether telomere length is a universal determinant of species longevity is not known. To determine whether telomere shortening can be a single parameter to predict species longevities, here we measured in parallel the telomere length of a wide variety of species (birds and mammals) with very different life spans and body sizes, including mouse (Mus musculus), goat (Capra hircus), Audouin's gull (Larus audouinii), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), and Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). We found that the telomere shortening rate, but not the initial telomere length alone, is a powerful predictor of species life span. These results support the notion that critical telomere shortening and the consequent onset of telomeric DNA damage and cellular senescence are a general determinant of species life span.},

Several `rejuvenating' interventions have been proposed to delay ageing and the onset of age-associated decline and disease to extend healthspan and lifespan. These interventions include metabolic manipulation, partial reprogramming, heterochronic parabiosis, pharmaceutical administration and senescent cell ablation. As the ageing process is associated with altered epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodelling, and non-coding RNAs, the manipulation of these mechanisms is central to the effectiveness of age-delaying interventions. This Review discusses the epigenetic changes that occur during ageing and the rapidly increasing knowledge of how these epigenetic mechanisms have an effect on healthspan and lifespan extension, and outlines questions to guide future research on interventions to rejuvenate the epigenome and delay ageing processes.},

However, its impact on the biological age of organisms and their long-term health remains unknown. Here, we performed extended (3-month) HPB, followed by a 2-month detachment period of anastomosed pairs. Old detached mice exhibited improved physiological parameters and lived longer than control isochronic mice. HPB drastically reduced the biological age of blood and liver based on epigenetic analyses across several clock models on two independent platforms; remarkably, this rejuvenation effect persisted even after 2 months of detachment. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of anastomosed mice showed an intermediate phenotype between old and young, suggesting a comprehensive multi-omic rejuvenation effect. In addition, old HPB mice showed transcriptome changes opposite to aging, but akin to several lifespan-extending interventions. Altogether, we reveal that long-term HPB can decrease the biological age of mice, in part through long-lasting epigenetic and transcriptome remodeling, culminating in the extension of lifespan and healthspan.},

'Global' targeting refers to the fact that rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions are the primary substrate for SHM. By contrast, 'local' targeting refers to the observation that mutations are confined to a 1\textendash 2 kilobase (kb) region in the variable region.SHM was once thought to target rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions exclusively. It has now been shown to occasionally mistarget oncogenes, including B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and CD95.Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for SHM, but the substrate specificity of AID cannot explain the targeting of SHM.DNA-repair processes are typically error-free but during SHM they are likely to be perturbed and rendered error-prone. The resulting error-prone repair pathway(s) must be targeted to rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions.Studies using {$\kappa$}-light chain (Ig{$\kappa$})-like transgenes showed that immunoglobulin enhancer regions are required for targeting SHM to variable regions. More recently, however, studies of endogenous immunoglobulin loci have called into question both the role of immunoglobulin enhancers in SHM and the usefulness of traditional transgenes in dissecting the molecular mechanism of targeting.Conventional histone modifications do not seem to have a direct role in targeting SHM. By contrast, the modification H2BSer14P (histone H2B phosphorylated on serine residue 14) is spatially and temporally correlated with SHM.Recent insights and the development of new experimental strategies should continue to determine the mechanisms by which SHM is targeted to immunologlobulin loci, as well as the reason that this reaction is occasionally mistargeted to oncogenes.},
