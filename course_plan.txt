The examples of networks modelling include: ...
* On the cellular scale, the mathematized MARS (mitochondria, aberrant proteins, radicals and scavengers) model describes the breakdown of cellular homeostasis in a networked approach 12

* Top-down computational models with discrete health states interacting with simple explicit networks116–118 have demonstrated how population-level measures such as survival curves can be generated from conceptually simple models of damage propagation within a complex system.

Recent advances in machine learning have allowed general dynamics of continuous longitudinal data to be modeled by deep neural networks for more than 29 covariants121.

- resilience in deterministic and stochastic systems

* If physiological systems are networks of interacting elements, then we can apply stochastic resilience theory to interpret dynamics of a whole suite of biological markers with aging. A key feature providing resilience to interacting networks is self-regulation within modules, while interactions among them might decrease resilience.
