# Computational Biology of Aging book

This is absolutely free open access book is devoted to the best practices in computational system biology of aging. If you are interested in reading please proceed to the [Book page](https://computationalaginglab.github.io/computational_aging_course/intro.html). Now this book is under development. If you want to contribute to this project, please read our short contribution remark below. If you have some questions feel free writing to this e-mail: <dmitrii.kriukov@skoltech.ru>.

## Abstract
This course is devoted to the study of key methods of computational biology of aging, which have had a significant impact on the field in recent years. We will take a detailed look at aging clock models, survival curves, Gompertz models, dynamical models as well as key aspects of the biology of aging (including its molecular part). Students will get experience in differential gene expression or methylation analysis in the context of aging, hazard ratio models fitting and interpretation, aging clocks construction and their exploration and develop an intuition in dynamical systems modeling. The course aims to form a systematic view of the biology of aging, and offer a holistic computational methodology for the study of this problem.


# How to contribute

If you want to contribute to this project, please follow this guide:
1. Choose a topic on computational aging biology where you have a particular expertise.
2. Provide the following materials:
    * write a lecture text in markdown (or MyST) format supplying it with images, videos and other embedded materials.
    * (recommended) prepare a jupyter notebook on some computational topic with clarification of the approach. Provide some code and necessary text and graphics as well as toy or real data examples of the approach application.
    * (would be great but not necessary) prepare a video with a presentation of your teaching materials. Actualy, these materials should be a repetition of what you're saying in the markdown text or notebook. Please, attach also a link to your presentation - put it into your lecture text.
3. Commit your materials to this repository and make a pull request.
4. (optional) To make the process faster, write about your intetion to contribute to this e-mail: <dmitrii.kriukov@skoltech.ru>
